# JavaScript SPA skeleton

This version uses Ampersand.js, React and Webpack.

* `npm run start` to start a local development server with hot reloading
* `npm run build` to create a static build to the public folder
* `npm run test` to lint the code 
* `npm run deploy` to deploy the public folder using Surge

## Thoughts

* ESLint is giving false errors about spacing after a comma in JSX. 
* React is kind of nice. Not convinced about JSX, but there's a big community and lots of resources.
* JavaScript build is 139 KB.
* Webpack.. hate the config, but like the fact that I don't need Gulp. I also like that I can import CSS styles.
